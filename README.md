## Cryptocurrency Pump and Dump Prediction via Deep Learning

Here we have trained a model to predict whether the real-time event of a selected asset in Binance exchange is a Pump event or not. 

Further we have developed a dashboard in which users can find out real-time pump scenarios, probability of that scenario happening, and the price changes of the recent days of that selected asset.


We referred several research papers. 
1.  "**[Crypto Pump and Dump Detection via Deep Learning Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04646)**" by Viswanath Chadalapaka, Kyle Chang, Gireesh Mahajan, and Anuj Vasil.
2.  "**[Pump and Dumps in the Bitcoin Era: Real Time Detection of Cryptocurrency Market Manipulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06610)**" by Massimo La Morgia, Alessandro Mei, Francesco Sassi, Julinda Stefa.
3.  "**[Anomaly Transformer: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Association Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02642)**" by Jiehui Xu, Haixu Wu, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long.
